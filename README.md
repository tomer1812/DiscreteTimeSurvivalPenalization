# Discrete-Time Competing-Risks Regression with or without Penalization

A Python code for the paper: 

"Discrete-time Competing-Risks Regression with or without Penalization", 2023.

[Tomer Meir](https://tomer1812.github.io/) and [Malka Gorfine](https://www.tau.ac.il/~gorfinem/)

The simulations and MIMIC-IV analysis can be replicated by cloning the repository, running the code in the notebooks directory using the docker image built from the Dockerfile of this project. 

The MIMIC-IV (2.0) dataset is accessible at [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/) and subjected to PhysioNet credentials.

This work is based on PyDTS Python Package:
